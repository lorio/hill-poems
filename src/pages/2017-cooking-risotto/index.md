—a new recipe small pieces<!-- end -->  
of asparagus &amp; shrimp, lemon juice   
prepared in separate pan &amp; I think  
of G. When did I last cook risotto, when  
did I last eat asparagus in March  
of which year

I am transported to Austrian spring  
crisp temperature, a field of brooks  
where we pick birds’ lettuce   
we hike, we cook   
there is sex, there is spring  
and asparagus, some cress &amp;<br>
birds lettuce picked at the brook

I stir risotto &amp; think how this recipe  
diverges from G's, to place inch-sized  
asparagus pieces in bowl of ice water  
I'll try but remember 

the warm bed &amp; kitchen, asparagus   
on dishes on linen now I add shrimp   
&amp; garlic, lemon juice 

Like the good food we had &amp; this<br>
takes my breath away&mdash;how food<br>
was good, how he disliked the  
way I chopped anything&mdash;he couldn't  
tolerate my kitchen skills, but the food  
was good, linen fresh, the bed warm  
and the brook ice cold in the ice cold  
spring

the image welling, the time   
I gave, the joy of&mdash;

How I am in Brooklyn  
my own job &amp; bag full of books how he'd<br>
wear an apron w/ his name stitched on  
by the girlfriend before me the one  
he devastated &amp; betrayed before me  
no betrayal it was an open relationship<br>
though she'd given him all before   
I was ready to bear   
his young

The food now in Brooklyn  
Austrian radio streams online  
I find comfort in those voices  
&amp; references to US culture

food on American bubble plates news<br>
turns to program on misunderstood<br>
songs:

The Police: I'll Be Watching You  
as I eat shrimp asparagus risotto<br>
“eine krankhafte einseitige Liebe”  
the Austrian journalist explains as if  
no one had noticed that before, well,<br>
maybe not the Austrians,   
but who cares?

I am a senior in college at parties   
dancing to this song who cares   
about the disease it's a fucking<br>
great song &amp; soon I'll fall for the<br>
Virginia townie who hangs out on  
campus where he wears a bandana<br>
and plays frisbee he's a local carpenter  
&amp; though I study German &amp; want to depart<br>
I fall for this man's grin, who takes me to<br>
West Virginia in his truck with the dog<br>
in the back it is spring in West Virginia<br>
down rural curvy road &amp; blooming apple<br>
trees &amp; I can't believe my eyes to be in<br>
that back woods place & so stoned I cannot  
speak &amp; so in love with this man I never<br>
want to leave any sort of Virginia

Then Austrian radio goes to another   
misunderstood song &amp; it's No Woman<br>
No Cry &amp; the journalist explains why<br>
people misunderstand this song and I'm  
eating shrimp risotto drunk on garlic  
and lemon juice on a Monday afternoon<br>
and there's my Nigerian friend Dele who  
taught me to eat with my hands in Vienna,   
explaining this song&mdash;doesn't everyone know   
this?&mdash;the singer consoles a woman 
 
how consoled I was at the America Latina   
where Dele sang w/ his reggae band  
on Mollardgasse in the 6th district   
where the drugs were as my neo-liberal   
anti-foreigner family explained   
so I went right there &amp; these  
drugs were NOTHING like the states  
&amp; I was consoled by a wee bit of 'shit' (sheet)  
&amp; the reggae music &amp; the Chilean waiter<br>
who I'd make out with on my way to the WC

and today it's shrimp risotto   
as good risotto should be   
this funny recipe minus linen cloth   
plus paper clips &amp; graded essays   
but the food &amp; the music 

this is what I love, have loved about my life.
