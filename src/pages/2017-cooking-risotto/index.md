—a new recipe small pieces<!-- end -->  
of asparagus &amp; shrimp lemon juice   
prepared in separate pan &amp; I think   
of G.—when did I last cook risotto when  
did I last eat asparagus in March  
of which year

I am transported to Austrian spring  
crispy temperature a field of brooks  
where we pick birds’ lettuce  
we hike we cook  
there is sex there is spring  
&amp; asparagus some cress &amp;  
birds’ lettuce picked at the brook  
I stir risotto &amp; think how this recipe  
diverges from G.’s—to place inch-sized  
asparagus pieces in bowl of ice water  
I’ll try but remember

the warm bed &amp; kitchen asparagus  
on dishes on linen now I add shrimp  
&amp; garlic lemon juice—  
like the good food we had &amp; this  
takes my breath away—how food  
was good how he disliked the   
way I chopped anything—he couldn’t   
tolerate my kitchen skills but the food  
was good linen fresh the bed warm  
&amp; the brook ice cold in the ice cold  
spring

the image welling the time   
I gave—the joy of—

how I am in Brooklyn   
my own job &amp; bag full of books how he’d   
wear an apron w/his name stitched on  
by the girlfriend before me the one  
he’d devastated &amp; betrayed before me  
no betrayal it was an open relationship  
though she’d given him all before  
I was ready to bear  
his young

the food now in Brooklyn  
Austrian radio streams online  
I find comfort in those voices  
&amp; references to U.S. culture

food on American bubble plates  
news turns to program   
on misunderstood songs:

The Police: I’ll Be Watching You  
as I eat shrimp asparagus risotto  
“eine krankhafte, einseitige Liebe”  
the Austrian journalist explains as if  
no one had noticed that before—well   
maybe not the Austrians  
but who cares?

I am a senior in college at parties   
dancing to this song who cares    
about the disease it’s a fucking   
great song &amp; soon I’ll fall for the    
Virginia townie who hangs out on    
campus where he wears a bandana   
and plays Frisbee he’s a local carpenter   
&amp; though I study German &amp; want to depart   
I fall for this man’s grin who takes me to    
West Virginia in his truck with the dog   
in the back it is spring in West Virginia   
down rural curvy road &amp; blooming apple   
trees & I can’t believe my eyes to be in    
that back woods place &amp; so stoned I cannot   
speak &amp; so in love with this man I never    
want to leave any sort of Virginia 

then Austrian radio goes to another  
misunderstood song &amp; its No Woman  
No Cry &amp; the journalist explains why   
people misunderstand this song &amp; I’m   
eating shrimp risotto drunk on garlic  
&amp; lemon juice on a Monday afternoon  
&amp; there’s my Nigerian friend Dele who  
taught me to eat with my hands in Vienna  
explaining this song—doesn’t everyone know  
this?—the singer consoles a woman

how consoled I was at the America Latina  
where Dele sang w/ his reggae band   
on Mollardgasse in the 6th district  
where the drugs were as my neo-liberal   
anti-foreigner family explained  
so I went right there &amp; these   
drugs were NOTHING like in the states  
&amp; I was consoled by a wee bit of ‘shit’ (sheet)  
&amp; the reggae music &amp; the Chilean waiter  
who I’d make out with on my way to the WC

&amp; today it’s shrimp risotto  
as good risotto should be  
this funny recipe minus linen cloth  
plus paper clips &amp; graded essays  
but the food &amp; the music

this is what I love—have loved about my life.
